### Motivation
In this competition I was working with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 
To predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition I was able to apply and enhance your data science skills.

This documentation contains general information about my approach and technical information about Kaggleâ€™s Predict Future Sales competition.


The dataset consists of daily historical sales data of over 22k items across 60 shops for periods from January 2013 to October 2015.  The goal is to predict the number of items sold for each of the item and shop combination for November 2015.  There are 2.9 million rows of data in the training set and 214k rows in the test set.

The repository includes 6 parts:<br>
  * Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Part 2: Feature Engineering
  * Part 3: Scaling and defining a validation plan
  * Part 4: DecisionTreeClassifier
  * Part 5: XGboost regressor
  * Part 6: Evaluation
  
The notebooks describe the thought process and steps taken to achieve the goal.
